# Synopsis

Quiz app using MEAN stack.
1st project to be deployed.
Deployed on Amazon EC2, currently taken down due to costs during my unemployment.

Features:
+ users can create profiles and add questions, and their answers
+ multiple choice quiz: three random questions pulled from the question pool
+ users scored on their performance, and put on scoreboard.
+ User accounts encrypted with Bcrypt.

#Motivation

+ First fully built MEAN project
+ First fully built project to be deployed (was taken off because one year free AWS ran out)
#Installation
+ download or clone from Github
+ run npm install

#API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

#Tests
1. install and run mongod and nodeamon for server.js
2. register and login
3. if this is the first time logging in, add at least two-three more questions
